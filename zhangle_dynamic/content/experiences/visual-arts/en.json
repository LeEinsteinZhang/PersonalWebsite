    "description": "Photography is a technique that uses light. I have worked as a commercial photographer, capturing images of large commercial events. I also founded a photography club with friends in high school and organized several large club events in the form of photography lectures. During this period, I received many awards from the school. Personally, I am particularly interested in classical photography.",
